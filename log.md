# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continue with my personal project SLACK-CLONE, today I have created an Auth hoc to protect the create-team route, fix some bugs with the user in the localstorage and refactor my webpack config.

**Thoughts:** I lose a lot of time trying to debug my code, I should learn ways to debug my code more efficient i think.

### Day 2: April 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I have no progress in my slackClone, instead today I learned to create templatetags in Django while I was writing a post in medium about how to connect the webpack-dev-derver with a #Django app.

**Thoughts:** Dude you have no idea how much time take to write a post

### Day 3: April 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Instead of building the layout of my #slackClone using normal css/flex I thought it should be funnier if I built it with css-grid. I finished the first section of the css-grid free-course in @scrimba_com

**Thoughts:** CSS-GRID is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!

### Day 4: April 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning about css-grid is enjoyable, it makes the layout so simple, I think I can finally continue with the layout of my #slackClone using css-grid + flexbox

**Thoughts:** CSS-GRID is so awesome!!!!!!!!!!!
