# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continue with my personal project SLACK-CLONE, today I have created an Auth hoc to protect the create-team route, fix some bugs with the user in the localstorage and refactor my webpack config.

**Thoughts:** I lose a lot of time trying to debug my code, I should learn ways to debug my code more efficient i think.
